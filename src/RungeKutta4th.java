 * class show example of an ordinary differential equation that is solved using the fourth order Runge-Kutta
 * approximation method.
 *
 * Notice that at the moment of writing, the class is not generified.
 * Also notice that an equation is chosen of which the exact solution is known so that it is easy to check the accuracy.
